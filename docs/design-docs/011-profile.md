## Key Flows

### Editing Profile

1. User taps "Edit Profile" → navigates to edit screen
2. Updates display name → `useUpdateProfile` saves to profiles table
3. Success feedback → returns to profile

### Viewing Public Profile

1. User taps owner name on listing or conversation
2. `usePublicProfile` fetches name, avatar, rating, member since
3. `usePublicListings` fetches their public items
4. Shows reviews via ratings feature

### Account Deletion (GDPR)

1. User navigates to delete account → warning about consequences
2. Must type "DELETE" to confirm
3. `useDeleteAccount` triggers deletion:
   - Items deleted
   - Conversations preserved with "[Deleted user]" marker
   - Ratings anonymized
   - Profile data removed

### Reporting Content

1. User taps "Report" on item or profile
2. Selects reason (inappropriate, spam, stolen goods, misleading condition, harassment, other)
3. Optional details → submits to reports table
