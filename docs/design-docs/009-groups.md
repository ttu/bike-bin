# Groups

## Overview

Community groups for sharing items with a defined set of users. Groups can be public (searchable, request to join) or private (invite-only). Members have roles: admin or member. Items can be scoped to specific groups via visibility settings, making them visible only to group members.

## Data Model

### Permission guards (groupPermissions.ts)

| Guard                             | Condition          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `canInvite(role)`                 | User is admin      |
| `canRemoveMember(role)`           | User is admin      |
| `canEditGroup(role)`              | User is admin      |
| `canDeleteGroup(role)`            | User is admin      |
| `canPromoteMember(role)`          | User is admin      |
| `canLeaveGroup(role, allMembers)` | Not the last admin |

## Screens & Navigation

| Route                             | Screen       | Purpose                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `(tabs)/groups/index.tsx`         | Groups List  | User's groups + search public groups |
| `(tabs)/groups/[id].tsx`          | Group Detail | Members, settings, join/leave        |

## Key Flows

### Creating a Group

1. User taps "Create group" → fills form (name, description, public/private)
2. `useCreateGroup` inserts group + adds creator as admin member
3. Group appears in user's groups list

### Joining a Public Group

1. User searches public groups → taps "Request to Join"
2. `useJoinGroup` adds user as member
3. User can now see group-scoped items

### Managing Members (Admin)

- Promote member to admin
- Remove member from group
- Invite new members
- Last admin cannot leave (must promote someone first)

## i18n

Namespace: `groups`

Key areas: `empty.*` (empty state), `search.*` (search groups), `create.*` (create form), `detail.*` (member list, admin actions, join/leave), `edit.*` (edit form), `visibility.*` (item visibility group selector).

## Current Status

- **Implemented:** Full CRUD, public/private groups, role-based permissions, member management, group search, item visibility scoping
- **Working:** All admin actions, join/leave flows, group-scoped item visibility
